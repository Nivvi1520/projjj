        <P>
            <pre><u>What Is a Chartered Accountant?</u></pre>
            A chartered accountant (CA) is an international accounting credential used 
            in many countries outside the U.S. The CA designation is the same thing as
             being a certified public accountant (CPA) in the U.S, which means the individual 
             is qualified to work as an accountant in the public or private sector.
            
            How Much Does a Chartered Accountant Make?
            The salary for a CA varies based on the company you work for and the country
             you practice in. For example, by some estimates, CAs earn:
            
            35,122 pounds per year in England
            33,509 pounds per year in Scotland
            31,970 pounds per year in Wales
            34,005 pounds per year in Northern Ireland
            In contrast, a chartered professional accountant in Canada (also called a CPA)
             earns a median salary of 62,500 Canadian dollars, while the Bureau of Labor 
             Statistics (BLS) reports that the median pay for accountants and auditors in the U.S.
              was $77,250 per year in 2021.

              <pre> <u> What Does a Chartered Accountant Do?</u></pre>
            A CA does everything a CPA does, including:
            
            Conducting financial audits
            Providing financial advice
            Giving tax planning advice
            Maintaining records and preparing reports
            Auditing records
            Preparing financial statements
            According to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), 
            chartered accountants work in every economic sector and may run their own accounting business. 
            They provide advice and lend their expertise to help leaders make sound financial decisions.
            
            Though CAs can work in any industry, including nonprofits (charity), audit and assurance,
             insolvency, and tax, chartered accountants primarily work in four key areas.
            
            1. Public Practice
            Many CAs work as general accountants and “provide a range of accounting and tax services
             to clients, including business advice, management consultancy, and audits,” says an ICAEW 
             spokesperson. They add, “Firms vary in size from the sole practitioner to one of the Big
              Four multinational accounting firms.”
            
            2. Business
            Some CAs work for private businesses, using their financial skills to help the company grow
             and assisting with the general management of the company. While the CA may do this as an 
             entry or mid-level accountant, many CAs also apply their skills in leadership roles, helping
              the company chart a financial course and providing leadership to other chartered accountants
               in the department.
            
            3. Corporate Finance
            CAs often work in corporate finance. The ICAEW spokesperson explains that large companies
             often have departments devoted to accounting and corporate finance. Chartered accountants
              in corporate finance may vet merger and acquisition deals or help restructure corporate debts.
            
            4. Forensic Accounting
            Finally, notes the spokesperson, CAs may provide forensic accounting services and act as 
            expert witnesses. They may use their accounting skills in a variety of investigations like
             commercial fraud, personal injury lawsuits, and other civil cases.
            
            What Kinds of Jobs Can a Chartered Accountant Have?
            During your time in an entry-level role, you’ll sharpen your skills and gain experience, 
            allowing you to move into more specialized chartered accountant roles. This could include 
            management and leadership or focusing on a specific area of accounting. Some example job 
            titles are:
            
            Controller
            Accounting manager
            Finance manager
            Accounting director
            Group controller
            How to Become a Chartered Accountant
            The process of becoming a chartered accountant varies based on where you studied and 
            what country you want to work in. For example, the ICAEW outlines this process to receive
             a CA designation:
            
            “You must complete the ACA [associated chartered accountant] which is made up of four components
             which include: practical work experience; 15 accountancy, finance, and business exams; 
             professional development; and, ethics and professional scepticism training.” 
            
            However, individual countries may have specific requirements for CAs. For instance, in Greece,
             you must complete two A levels and three general certificates of secondary education (GCSEs) — 
             or the international equivalent of three GCSEs. But in India, you have to sit for three of the 
             advanced level examinations and ethics courses.
            
            Other countries may have their own credentialing bodies and requirements. To become a CPA in 
            Canada, you must:
            
            Hold a degree from an accredited institution (or have the equivalent education)
            Prove you have sufficient competence in the area you want to focus on (like audit and assurance
             or business law)
            Complete three years of mentored practical experience
            Pass the exam
            Can a Chartered Accountant Become a CPA (or Vice Versa)?
            Because the CA and CPA designations are similar, a CA won’t necessarily have to go through
             the same credentialing procedure a new accountant would to become a CPA. Some U.S. states 
             have a reciprocity agreement with CA credentialing bodies that allow those with a CA designation 
             to work as a CPA in the U.S. without needing to pursue a CPA. As part of that agreement, CPAs 
             may also be able to work in certain countries without pursuing a full CA designation.
            
            What Skills Does a Chartered Accountant Need?
            While a career as a chartered accountant requires hard skills such as numeracy, data analysis,
             and computer skills like spreadsheets, soft skills are also a necessary part of the role.
            
            The ICAEW says that, for example, “A job in corporate finance requires skills in negotiation with 
            finance providers, lawyers, researchers, and other key professionals.” You’ll also likely need 
            strong skills in conflict resolution, respectfulness, and prioritization to ensure your clients 
            trust your recommendations and advice.
