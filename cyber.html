        What is cyber security?
        Cyber security is how individuals and organisations reduce the risk of cyber attack.
        Cyber security's core function is to protect the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), and the services we access - both online and at work - from theft or damage.
        It's also about preventing unauthorised access to the vast amounts of personal information we store on these devices, and online.

        Types of Cyber Security
        Every organization's assets are the combinations of a variety of different systems. 
        These systems have a strong cybersecurity posture that requires coordinated efforts across all of its systems. Therefore, we can categorize cybersecurity in the following sub-domains:
        <ul>
        <li>Network Security: It involves implementing the hardware and software to secure a computer network from unauthorized access, intruders, attacks, disruption,
             and misuse. This security helps an organization to protect its assets against external and internal threats.</li>
        <li>Application Security: It involves protecting the software and devices from unwanted threats. This protection can be done by constantly updating the apps to 
            ensure they are secure from attacks. Successful security begins in the design stage, writing source code, validation, threat modeling, etc., before a program 
            or device is deployed.</li>
        <li>Mobile Security: It involves securing the organizational and personal data stored on mobile devices such as cell phones, computers, tablets, and other similar
             devices against various malicious threats. These threats are unauthorized access, device loss or theft, malware, etc.</li>
        <li>User Education: It deals with the processes, monitoring, alerts, and plans to how an organization responds when any malicious activity is causing the loss of
             operations or data. Its policies dictate resuming the lost operations after any disaster happens to the same operating capacity as before the event.</li>
    </ul>
