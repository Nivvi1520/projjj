        Our JavaScript Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. JavaScript is used to create client-side dynamic pages.

        JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.
        
        JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.
        
        What is JavaScript
        JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several
         websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language 
         that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was
          introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigato
          r browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With 
          JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading
           the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of i
           nteractivity and simplicity
           Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.

Features of JavaScript
There are following features of JavaScript:

All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.
It is a case-sensitive language.
JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.
History of JavaScript
In 1993, Mosaic, the first popular web browser, came into existence. In the year 1994, Netscape was founded by Marc Andreessen. He realized that the web needed to become more dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language' was believed to be provided to HTML to make web designing easy for designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the company recruited Brendan Eich intending to implement and embed Scheme programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan could start, the company merged with Sun Microsystems for adding Java into its Navigator so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web technologies and platforms. Now, two languages were there: Java and the scripting language. Further, Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'. Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen coined the first code of Javascript named 'Mocha'. Later, the marketing team replaced the name with 'LiveScript'. But, due to trademark reasons and certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was finally renamed to 'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript came into existence.

Application of JavaScript
JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:



Client-side validation,
Dynamic drop-down menus,
Displaying date and time,
Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),
Displaying clocks etc.
What is JavaScript ?
JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
Designed for creating network-centric applications.
Complementary to and integrated with Java.
Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
Open and cross-platform
Client-Side JavaScript
Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.

It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.

The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.

The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.

JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.

Advantages of JavaScript
The merits of using JavaScript are −

Less server interaction − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.

Immediate feedback to the visitors − They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.

Increased interactivity − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.

Richer interfaces − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.

Limitations of JavaScript
We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features −

Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.

JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.

JavaScript doesn't have any multi-threading or multiprocessor capabilities.

Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.

JavaScript Development Tools
One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not require expensive development tools. You can start with a simple text editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted language inside the context of a web browser, you don't even need to buy a compiler.

To make our life simpler, various vendors have come up with very nice JavaScript editing tools. Some of them are listed here −

Microsoft FrontPage Microsoft has developed a popular HTML editor called FrontPage. FrontPage also provides web developers with a number of JavaScript tools to assist in the creation of interactive websites.

Macromedia Dreamweaver MX acromedia Dreamweaver MX is a very popular HTML and JavaScript editor in the professional web development crowd. It provides several handy prebuilt JavaScript components, integrates well with databases, and conforms to new standards such as XHTML and XML.

Macromedia HomeSite 5HomeSite 5 is a well-liked HTML and JavaScript editor from Macromedia that can be used to manage personal websites effectively.

Where is JavaScript Today ?
The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be released in over four years. JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between the two is extremely minor.

The specification for JavaScript 2.0 can be found on the following site:

Today, Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript conform to the ECMAScript standard, although both the languages still support the features that are not a part of the standard.
