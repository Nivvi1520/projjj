            <h1><u>HTML</u></h1>
            <P>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for
                 creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. 
                 HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser 
                 how to display the content.</P>

            <h1><u>CSS</u></h1>
            <P>
                <pre>What is CSS?</pre><br>
                Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design 
                language intended to transform the presentation of a Web Pages
                 as well as many ostensibly nonweb environments.
                
                CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, 
                you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the
                 spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out,
                  what background images or colors are used, layout designs,
                  variations in display for different devices and screen sizes 
                  as well as a variety of other effects.
                
                CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides 
                powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. 
                Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.
                
                Strictly speaking CSS is not a programming language 
                but it does require abstract thought. It is also not purely a design tool, 
                but it does require some creativity.
                Where do we use CSS?
                CSS is being used extensively in web and non web based applications :
                
                All modern websites make use of CSS to beautify their web pages.
                Embedded-device displays often use CSS to style their user interfaces.
                RSS clients also let you apply CSS to feeds and feed entries.
                Instant message clients also use CSS to format chat windows.</P>

            <h1><u>JAVA SCRIPT</u></h1>
            <P>JavaScript is an open-source programming language designed for creating web-centric applications.
                 It is lightweight and interpreted which makes it much faster than other languages and is integrated 
                 with HTML making it easier to implement in web applications.

                In this Introduction to JavaScript article, you will learn all 
                about JavaScript, the backbone of web development, and understand what exactly this
                 language is and why and how this language is used across various fields.
                
                JavaScript is critical for web development, and if you’ve ever thought about 
                choosing that career path, you’d surely have come across this language.
                 And probably, that’s why you are here in the first place.
                Here are the topics covered in this Introduction to JavaScript article:Introduction to JavaScript

                 the Javascript Certification Training Course. Check out the course preview!
                Introduction to JavaScript
                JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to create and manage 
                dynamic web pages, basically anything that moves on your screen without requiring you to 
                refresh your browser. 
                It can be anything from animated graphics to an automatically generated Facebook timeline. 
                
                jsFig: JavaScript
                When most people get interested in web development, they start with good old 
                HTML and CSS. From there, they move on to JavaScript, which makes sense,
                 because, these three elements together form the backbone of web development.
                
                HTML is the structure of your page like the headers, the body text, 
                any images you want to include. It basically defines the contents of a web page.
                CSS controls how that page looks (it’s what you’ll use to customize fonts,
                 background colors, etc.).
                JavaScript is the third element. Once you’ve created your structure 
                (HTML) and your aesthetic vibe (CSS), JavaScript makes your site dynamic 
                (automatically updateable).</P>

            <h1><u>JAVA</u></h1>
            <P>
                <pre>What is java?</pre>
                
                Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, 
                object-oriented and secure programming language.
                
                Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) 
                in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, 
                its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling 
                and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
                Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, 
                is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, 
                it is called a platform.
                According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where 
                Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:
                Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
                Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.
                Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
                Mobile
                Embedded System
                Smart Card
                Robotics
                Games, etc.</P>

            <h1><u>SQL</u></h1>
            <P>SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is used for storing and managing data in
                 relational database management system (RDMS).
                It is a standard language for Relational Database System. It enables a user to create, 
                read, update and delete relational databases and tables.
                All the RDBMS like MySQL, Informix, Oracle, MS Access and SQL Server use SQL as their 
                standard database language.
                SQL allows users to query the database in a number of ways, using English-like statements.
                SQL follows the following rules: Structure query language is not case sensitive.
                 Generally, keywords of SQL are written in uppercase.
                Statements of SQL are dependent on text lines. We can use a single SQL statement
                 on one or multiple text line.
                Using the SQL statements, you can perform most of the actions in a database.
                SQL depends on tuple relational calculus and relational algebra.
                SQL process:
                When an SQL command is executing for any RDBMS, then the system figure out 
                the best way to carry out the request and the SQL engine determines that how 
                to interpret the task.
                In the process, various components are included. These components can be 
                optimization Engine, Query engine, Query dispatcher, classic, etc.
                All the non-SQL queries are handled by the classic query engine, but SQL
                 query engine won't handle logical files.
                </P>
