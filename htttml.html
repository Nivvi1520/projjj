        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to
           write Web Pages.
            Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked
           together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.
             As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to
          simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure
          it to display.
          Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like
             headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information
           between researchers.
            Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available
                in HTML language.
              Basic HTML Documentor let's save it in an HTML file test.htm using your favorite text
editor. Finally open it using a web browser like Internet Explorer or Google Chrome, or Firefox
etc. It must show the following output:

HTML Tags
As told earlier, HTML is a markup language and makes use of various tags to format the
content. These tags are enclosed within angle braces. Except few tags, most
of the tags have their corresponding closing tags. For example,  has its closing
tagand tag has its closing tag  tag etc.
Above example of HTML document uses the following tags:
Tag Description
This tag defines the document type and HTML version.

This tag encloses the complete HTML document and mainly comprises
of document header which is represented by  and
document body which is represented by tags.
 tag represents the document's header which can keep other HTML
tags like etc.
 The tag is used inside the  tag to mention the
document title.
This tag represents the document's body which keeps other HTML tags
like etc.
This tag represents the heading.

This tag represents a paragraph.
To learn HTML, you will need to study various tags and understand how they behave, while
formatting a textual document. Learning HTML is simple as users have to learn the usage of
different tags in order to format the text or images to make a beautiful webpage.
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends to use lowercase tags starting from HTML
4.
HTML Document Structure
A typical HTML document will have the following structure:
Document declaration tag

We will study all the header and body tags in subsequent chapters, but for now let's see what
is document declaration tag.
The  Declaration
The  declaration tag is used by the web browser to understand the version of
the HTML used in the document. Current version of HTML is 5 and it makes use of the following
declaration:
There are many other declaration types which can be used in HTML document depending on
what version of HTML is being used. We will see more details on this while discussingtag along with other HTML tags.
Heading Tags
Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also
has six levels of headings, which use the elements While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that
heading.
Example

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>

This will produce the following result:

Paragraph Tag
The  tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of
text should go in between an opening and a closing  tag as shown below in the
example:
Example

This will produce the following result:
Here is a first paragraph of text.
Here is a second paragraph of text.
Here is a third paragraph of text.

Line Break Tag
Whenever you use the  element, anything following it starts from the next line. This
tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as
there is nothing to go in between them.
The tag has a space between the characters br and the forward slash. If you omit this
space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the line break, while if you miss the forward
slash character and just use it is not valid in XHTML.
Example

This will produce the following result:
Hello
You delivered your assignment on time.
Thanks
Mahnaz
Centering Content
You can use  tag to put any content in the center of the page or any table cell.
Example


This will produce the following result:
This text is not in the center.
This text is in the center.
Horizontal Lines
Horizontal lines are used to visually break-up sections of a document. The  tag creates
a line from the current position in the document to the right margin and breaks the line
accordingly.
For example, you may want to give a line between two paragraphs as in the given example
below:
Example
This will produce the following result:
This is paragraph one and should be on top
This is paragraph two and should be at bottom
Again tag is an example of the empty element, where you do not need opening and
closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them.
The  element has a space between the characters hr and the forward slash. If you
omit this space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the horizontal line, while if you
miss the forward slash character and just use it is not valid in XHTML
Preserve Formatting
Sometimes, you want your text to follow the exact format of how it is written in the HTML
document. In these cases, you can use the preformatted tag 
Any text between the opening  tag and the closing tag will preserve the
formatting of the source document.
Try using the same code without keeping it inside tags
Nonbreaking Spaces
Suppose you want to use the phrase "12 Angry Men." Here, you would not want a browser to
split the "12, Angry" and "Men" across two lines:
An example of this technique appears in the movie "12 Angry Men."
In cases, where you do not want the client browser to break text, you should use a
nonbreaking space entity instead of a normal space. For example, when coding the
"12 Angry Men" in a paragraph, you should use something similar to the following code:
Example

An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends
with a closing tag, where the element name is preceded by a forward slash as shown below
with few tags:
Start Tag Content End Tag
